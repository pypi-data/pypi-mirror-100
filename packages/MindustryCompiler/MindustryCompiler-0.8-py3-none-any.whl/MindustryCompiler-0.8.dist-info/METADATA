# MindustryCompiler

a langage that compile to mindustry asm code,

What's mindustry asm ? Here is a nice starting guide with in game screenshots:
[How To Use Procesors in 6.0](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2268059244)

The language created here is a subset of what I call mindustry asm code [named Mindustry Logic by it's creator](https://github.com/MindustryGame/wiki/blob/master/docs/logic/0-introduction.md)

## features

- all mindustry asm code are valide as it

- jump to a reference:

    ```plain
    ...
    jump bottom always true true  <--- jump to #ref bottom
    ...
    #ref bottom  <--- set ref anywhere
    ...
    ```

- comments:

    ```plain
    // this is a comment

    #ref loop // another comment after some blank lines
    ```

## coming soon

- improve jump conition:

- if condition:

- else, else if:

- multiple condition:

- function:

## current usage

- compile a file :

    ```sh
    > mindc fileName
    ```

    exemple, in this folder:

    ```sh
    > mindc tests/identicalCode/3-comments.code
    ```

- get the result in clipboard to just past it in mindustry :

    ```sh
    > mindc --ctrlC tests/identicalCode/3-comments.code
    ```

- run interactive to play with it :

    ```sh
    > mindc --interactive
    ```
