# Relay game

Relay game is an example of how Raspberry Pi and our SDK can be used to control
relays. Relays are just electrically controlled switches, which makes them easy
to understand and use. The main idea behind a relay is that it can control relatively
high voltage and current with a small control signal.

[Here](https://docs.surrogate.tv/relay_game.html) is the full documentation.

SurroRTG SDK official documentation can be found [here](https://docs.surrogate.tv/).
The documentation can be also built locally following
the instructions in SurroRTG repository README.
