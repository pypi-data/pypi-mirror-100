This document explains how to use a surrogate.tv game dashboard and game settings pages. Every time a game is created on surrogate.tv 
the game creator automatically gets these pages available for their access.

`Game dashboard` provides the necessary tools for maintaining and hosting a live game. The url for your game dashboard is
`www.surrogate.tv/game/<SHORT_ID_YOU_CHOSE>/dashboard`. You can access the dashboard by choosing `admin` from the menu accessible
from your profile picture (at top right), and by choosing the specific game from the admin game list. 

`Game settings` is used when setting up a game, but is rarely needed for maintaining one. The url for your game settings is
`www.surrogate.tv/game/<SHORT_ID_YOU_CHOSE>/settings`. You can easily access the settings from the bottom left on your game dashboard.
