        Find the (approximately) best number of workers to use for a particular DataLoader.

        Parameters
        ----------
        loader: DataLoader Class
            DataLoader for the dataset you want to check on
        start_workers: Integer
            How many workers to start from
        max_workers: Integer
            How many workers to end at
        worker_step: Integer
            Step size of number of workers
        iterations_per_worker: Integer
            The number of iterations we run each loader for, the larger the better
            in order to get a better approximation, but the longer the time.
        num_averages: Integer
            How many times we do the same experiment for specific number of workers
        set_pin_memory: Boolean
            Change DataLoader pin memory to True by default
        verbose: Boolean
            Prints information of iterations/second for every worker

        Returns
        -------
        int
            Number of workers found to be best
