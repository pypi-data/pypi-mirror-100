"""
A Flow is a simplified Graph, this originally used NetworkX but it was replaced
with a bespoke graph implementation as the NetworkX implementation was being
monkey-patches to make it easier to use. The decision was made to write a
specialized, albeit simple, graph library that didn't require monkey-patching.
