Description: # eazynlp
        NLP made easy for researchers
        
        ## What is it?
        
        **eazynlp** is a Python package aimed at qualitative researchers, especially in the social sciences, that wish to take advantage of natural language processing to complement traditional qualitative research methods. 
        In particular, **eazynlp** is unique in that commonly used entities of qualitative research, such as interview transcripts, are treated as first-class objects.
        This gives the researcher the opportunity to directly express NLP procedures in the analysis of such entities.
        
        ## Main Features:
          - Construction of data pipelines
          - Feature engineering
          - Cluster analysis, e.g., topic modeling
          - Visualization
        
        ## Where to get it
