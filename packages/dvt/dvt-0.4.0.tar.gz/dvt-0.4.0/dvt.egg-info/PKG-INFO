Description: 
        The Distant TV Toolkit is a Python package designed to facilitate the
        computational analysis of visual culture. It contains low-level architecture
        for applying state-of-the-art computer vision algorithms to still and moving
        images. Extracted information can be visualized for search and discovery or
        aggregated and analyzed to find patterns across a corpus.
        
        The Distant Viewing Toolkit is supported by the National Endowment for the
        Humanities through a Digital Humanities Advancement Grant. It is released under
        the open-source GNU General Public License (GPLv2).
