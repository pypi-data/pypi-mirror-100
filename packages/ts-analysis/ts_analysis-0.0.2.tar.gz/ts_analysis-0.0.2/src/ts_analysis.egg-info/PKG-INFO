Description: # Time Series Analysis
        
        This is a MixIn framework to:
           1.  read data (from files, stdin etc.)
           2.  extract one or more event time series 
           3.  run analysis to identify points of interest on the timeline 
           4.  translate the found events in extracted time series back to
           (presumably time) markers in original data
           5.  write finalized output in some format
        
        MixIns for a pipeline are:
        
        * Input
        * Analysis Method
        * Output
        * Logging
        
        ## Approaches
        
        Below is a list of currently implemented approaches.
        
        ### Kendall Correlation 
        
        Kendall rank correlation coefficient (aka Kendall's Ï„ coefficient) performs
        pairwise identification of positive or negative correlation in two
        timeseries.
        
        ### Time Motifs
        
        Time motifs are repeating patterns which indicate an underlying common cause.  Details on these approaches can be [found here][scrimp paper].
