Description: # Learning Collision-free and Torque-limited Robot Trajectories based on Alternative Safe Behaviors
        This python package provides the code to learn torque-limited and collision-free robot trajectories without exceeding limits on the position, velocity, acceleration and jerk of each robot joint.
        
        ## Installation
        
        The package can be installed by running
        
            pip install safemotions
        
        ## Trajectory Generation
        
        To generate a random trajectory with a single robot run
        
            python -m safemotions.random_agent
        
        For a demonstration scenario with two robots run
        
            python -m safemotions.random_agent --robot_scene=1
        
        Collision-free trajectories for three robots can be generated by running
        
            python -m safemotions.random_agent --robot_scene=2
        
        Further documentation and instructions for training via RL coming soon ...
