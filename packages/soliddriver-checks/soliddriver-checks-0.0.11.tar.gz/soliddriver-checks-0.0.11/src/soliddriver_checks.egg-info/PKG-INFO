                "password": "password",
                "ssh_port": 22,
                "query": "suse"
              },
              {
        		"check": "True",
        		"ip": "10.67.18.39",
        		"user": "username",
        		"password": "password",
        		"ssh_port": 22,
        		"query": "vendor"
        	}

           }
           ```
           ```query```: respensent the supported flag you can give all, suse, vendor, unknow to it.
