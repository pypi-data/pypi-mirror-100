# Financefeast

A client library to call the Financefeast API

Note: this is alpha quality code still, the API may change, and things may fall apart while you try it.

# Quick start

## Installation

`financefeast` is available from [pypi](https://pypi.org/project/{INSERT ME HERE}/) so you can install it as usual:

```

## Usage
You must supply your client id and client secret. Two ways, either when you create an instance of Financefeast by passing
client_id and client_secret as args.

```
client = FinanceFeast(client_id="SOME ID", client_secret="SOME SECRET")
```

or

Using environment variables CLIENT_ID and CLIENT_SECRET.

```
client = FinanceFeast()
```
