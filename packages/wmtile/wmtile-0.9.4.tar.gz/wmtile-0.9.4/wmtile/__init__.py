"""window tiler for XFCE desktop environment

Always give to wmtile one and only one argument.

wmtile reshapes in 7 different ways all windows in the current workspace.

wmtile is a CLI program, but you should use it either by mouse (via wmtile -i)...

    $ wmtile -i
    installing 7 wmtile panel launchers
        panel launcher --> wmtile -m # Minimize
        panel launcher --> wmtile -t # reshape as Tiles
        panel launcher --> wmtile -p # reshape as Portraits
        panel launcher --> wmtile -l # reshape as Landscapes
        panel launcher --> wmtile -s # reshape as a Stack
        panel launcher --> wmtile -b # reshape as Big = maximize
        panel launcher --> wmtile -c # gracefully Close

...or by keyboard (via wmtile -k)

    $ wmtile -k
    installing 7 wmtile keyboard shortcuts
        Alt+Shift+M --> wmtile -m # Minimize
        Alt+Shift+T --> wmtile -t # reshape as Tiles
        Alt+Shift+P --> wmtile -p # reshape as Portraits
        Alt+Shift+L --> wmtile -l # reshape as Landscapes
        Alt+Shift+S --> wmtile -s # reshape as a Stack
        Alt+Shift+B --> wmtile -b # reshape as Big = maximize
        Alt+Shift+C --> wmtile -c # gracefully Close
