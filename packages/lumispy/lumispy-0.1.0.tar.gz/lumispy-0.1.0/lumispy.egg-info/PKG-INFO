        LumiSpy is an extension Python package for multi-dimensional data analysis 
        provided by the [HyperSpy](http://hyperspy.org) library. It is aimed at helping 
        with the analysis of luminescence spectroscopy data (cathodoluminescence, 
        photoluminescence, electroluminescence, Raman, SNOM).
        
        LumiSpy is released under the GPL v3 license. 
        
        If analysis using LumiSpy forms a part of published work please consider 
        recognising the code development by citing the
        [github repository](www.github.com/lumispy/lumispy).

        [Tutorials and example workflows](https://github.com/lumispy/lumispy-demos)
        have been curated as a series of Jupyter notebooks that you can work through 
        and modify to perform many common analyses. Simply:
        
        1. Download the `lumispy_demos` repository in your desired folder
        2. Load lumispy (as shown above)
        3. In Jupyter lab, navigate to the folder and start using the notebook
