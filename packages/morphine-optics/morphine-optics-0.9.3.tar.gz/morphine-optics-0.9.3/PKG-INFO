Description: poppy-derivatives (morphine)
        
        morphine is a Python package that simulates physical optical propagation including diffraction, with automatic differentiation.
        
        poppy was developed by Marshall Perrin and colleagues at STScI, for use simulating the James Webb Space Telescope
        and other NASA missions. Morphine is a fork of poppy by Benjamin Pope, adapting it to use Google Jax for autodiff.
