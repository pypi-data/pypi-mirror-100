        ## Roadmap
        
        Lots of nice-to-have things which I haven't done yet and might never do:
        
        - actual arg parsing
        - multiple output formats, including CSV and JSON from computed stats
        - ASCII-art graphs showing your days of highest spend
        - thresholding to remove "negligible" cost services from the output by default
        - data trimming and normalization to remove up-front spend and other "aberrant"
          data points from variance and average calculations
        - interactive CLI mode
        - multi-account data aggregation using assume-role with configured roles
