        # Description
        Removes private packages from a general `requirements.txt` file.
        
        
        ## Usage
        An example of usage is installing private packages. My usual workflow consists of
        1. changes in the source code,
        1. `pip freeze > requirements.txt`
        1. and `git add .` and `git commit -m "commit massage"`.
            However, my private packages were included and the CI build would fail because of
            the peculiar syntax required to install
            [private packages](https://docs.readthedocs.io/en/stable/guides/private-python-packages.html).
        1. The private package was manually removed from the `requirements.txt` and another `commit` was executed.
        
        This package was created to avoid this situation. Storing the private packages
        in a different file (e.g., `requirements-private.txt`), it removes the
        packages already presented inside `requirements-private.txt` from the `requirements.txt`
        avoiding the manual deletion and the commit correcting the change.
        
        The recommended use is adding in the `.pre-commit-config.yaml` file
        ```
          - repo: https://github.com/mashi/requirements-filter
            rev: v0.0.0  # replace by desired tag version
            hooks:
              - id: rqf
                args: [--filename1, requirements.txt, --filename2, requirements-private.txt]  # example with arguments
        ```
        
        In this way, the packages are checked before the `commit` and prevents the inclusion in the version control.
        
        
        ## Instructions (Development)
        Create a virtual environment and install the required packages with
        ```
        python3 -m venv .venv
        source .venv/bin/activate
        pip install wheel
        pip install -r requirements.txt
        pre-commit install
        ```
