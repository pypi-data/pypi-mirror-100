# yapymake

A (mostly) [POSIX-compatible](https://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/utilities/make.html) make implemented in Python.

## conformance

- internationalization (`LANG`/`LC_ALL`/`LC_CTYPE`/`LC_MESSAGES`) not implemented
- XSI conformance (SCCS integration) not implemented
- signal handling not implemented
- library handling not implemented
- some POSIX-specified features are pending (search `TODO` for a list)

## status

there are no automated tests whatsoever, so if this works, consider that a coincidence.
that said, it might work.
