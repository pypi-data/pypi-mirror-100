Description: # yapymake
        
        A (mostly) [POSIX-compatible](https://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/utilities/make.html) make implemented in Python.
        
        ## conformance
        
        - internationalization (`LANG`/`LC_ALL`/`LC_CTYPE`/`LC_MESSAGES`) not implemented
        - XSI conformance (SCCS integration) not implemented
        - signal handling not implemented
        - library handling not implemented
        - some POSIX-specified features are pending (search `TODO` for a list)
        - builtin macro `MAKE` is defined as `sys.argv[0]` (i.e. however you invoked `yapymake`)
        
        ## status
        
        there are no automated tests whatsoever, so if this works, consider that a coincidence.
        that said, I test manually on complicated projects, and the current record for most complex project which builds successfully with yapymake is Tcl.
