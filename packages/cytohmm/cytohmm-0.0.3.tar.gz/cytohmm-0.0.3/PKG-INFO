Description: # CytoHMM
        
        Hidden Markov models for cytogenetic microarrays.  Will be copying
        code from the repository Markov-models over here.  Then later it will
        be moved.
        
        At this point primarily Affymetrix arrays are addressed.  There is no
        reason why Illumina microarrays couldn't use this code.
        
        
        ## Installation
        
        Currently numpy and cython need to be preinstalled in the environment. The 
        the 0.0.x version number is due to working out the installation and 
        documentation.
