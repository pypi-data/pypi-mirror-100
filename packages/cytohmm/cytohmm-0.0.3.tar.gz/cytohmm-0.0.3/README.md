# CytoHMM

Hidden Markov models for cytogenetic microarrays.  Will be copying
code from the repository Markov-models over here.  Then later it will
be moved.

At this point primarily Affymetrix arrays are addressed.  There is no
reason why Illumina microarrays couldn't use this code.


## Installation

Currently numpy and cython need to be preinstalled in the environment. The 
the 0.0.x version number is due to working out the installation and 
documentation.

## Usage
