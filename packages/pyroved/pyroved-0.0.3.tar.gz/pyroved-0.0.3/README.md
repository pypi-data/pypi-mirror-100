Variational encoder-decoder models in Pyro probabilistic programming language for applications in spectral and image analysis. The currently available models include variational autoencoders with translational and/or rotational invariance for unsupervised, class-conditioned and semi-supervised learning. More models to come!

Please check out our interactive [examples](https://colab.research.google.com/github/ziatdinovmax/pyroVED/blob/main/examples/pyroVED_examples.ipynb) and let us know if you have any questions or if you would like to see the addition of any specific functionality!
