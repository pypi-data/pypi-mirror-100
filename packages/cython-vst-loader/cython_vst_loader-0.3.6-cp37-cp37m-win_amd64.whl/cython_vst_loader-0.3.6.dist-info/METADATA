## Project goals
The purpose is to have a simple wrapper for VST plugins to be used in higher-level projects, such as https://github.com/hq9000/py_headless_daw

## Supported plugins

Recreating a complete VST host environment in Python is a challenging task. 
Because of that, not every plugin will work with this wrapper, many are known not to work.
Also, in case of a closed-source plugins, troubleshooting issues is almost impossible.

Because of that, the loader "officially" supports (by testing) a limited number of free and (mostly) open source plugins. 
Other plugins may or may not work, if you discover an open source plugin that is causing issues, feel free to write a bug.  

The list of (tested/known-not-to-work/reportedly-working) plugins will be refreshed as new information arrives.

Note: only 64-bit/VST2 plugins are currently supported.
