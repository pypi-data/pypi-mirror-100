        Unless your computer has 1 GB RAM...
        
        ## Importing
        `from virus.functions import Virus`
        
        ## Tutorial (some what)
        The module is quite basic, it has only one class called `Virus` and has one callable function called `open_website()`
        
        `Virus.open_website()`
        
        *Parameters*
        ```
        duration
          Type: int
        ```
        
        ## Example usage
        ```py
        import virus
        from virus.functions import Virus
        
        starter = Virus()
        starter.open_website(1) #Now random websites will be opened for the next 1 minute
        ```
        
        
        The default duration is 10 minutes and the duration is to be entered in **minutes**. The virus will open a website every second until the time is over
        
        Now you must be thinking, running a python script in your friend's computed cannot be considered a *'virus'*. You can convert it into an executable file using [pyinstaller](https://pypi.org/project/pyinstaller/)
