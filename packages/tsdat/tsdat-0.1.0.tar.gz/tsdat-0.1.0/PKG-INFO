Description: # Time Series Data Library
        This library provides general utility methods for working with 
        time series datasets, which are stored as Xarray Dataset objects.
        In particular, it will provide declarative methods for being able
        standardize, apply Q/C checks, correct, and transform datastreams
        as a whole, reducing the amount of coding required for data
        processing.
        
        # Installation
        This library depends on the ARM ACT library which will be used
        for plotting and data standardization.  You can install it via
        pip, but it has problems on Windows because some of the 
        dependencies require C code to be built.  It's way easier to 
        install the environment via Anaconda, which is described below.
        If you do not want to use Anaconda, you can install the tsdat
        requirements via:
        
        ```bash
        pip3 install -r requirements.txt
        ```
        
        ## 1) Install Anaconda
        We recommend using Anaconda to install the required Python environment.
        because some of our plotting dependencies
        require libraries that are difficult to set up on windows machines.

        ## 2) Create Anaconda Environment
        
        ```bash
        conda create -n tsdat_env -c conda-forge python=3.8 act-atmos cfunits yamllint
        ```
        
        Note that Windows users should open the anaconda prompt and run this there.

        ## 3) OR Activate Existing Anaconda Environment
        ```bash
        conda activate tsdat_env
        ```
