# Time Series Data Library
This library provides general utility methods for working with 
time series datasets, which are stored as Xarray Dataset objects.
In particular, it will provide declarative methods for being able
standardize, apply Q/C checks, correct, and transform datastreams
as a whole, reducing the amount of coding required for data
processing.
