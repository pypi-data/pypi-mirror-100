Description: # Time Series Data Library
        This library provides general utility methods for working with 
        time series datasets, which are stored as Xarray Dataset objects.
        In particular, it will provide declarative methods for being able
        standardize, apply Q/C checks, correct, and transform datastreams
        as a whole, reducing the amount of coding required for data
        processing.
