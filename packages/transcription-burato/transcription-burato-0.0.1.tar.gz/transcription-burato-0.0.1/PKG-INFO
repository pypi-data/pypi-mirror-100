Description: # transcription-burato
        
        transcription
        The package transcription-burato is used to:
        	- create RNA from DNA
        
        ## What is a transcription?
        
        During the transcription process, the information encoded in the DNA sequence of one or more genes, adenine (A), cytosine (C), guanine (G) and thymine (T), is transcribed on an RNA strand, also called RNA transcription. The resulting single-stranded RNA molecule, composed of ribonucleotides containing the bases uracil (U),guanine (G), cytosine (C) and adenine (A)
