# streamrip

A scriptable stream downloader for Qobuz, Tidal, and Deezer.

## Features

- Downloads tracks, albums, playlists, discographies, and labels from Qobuz, Tidal, and Deezer

- Automatically converts files to a preferred format
- Has a database that stores the downloaded tracks' IDs so that repeats are avoided
- Easy to customize with the config file

## Installation

First, ensure [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installing/) is installed. Then run the following in the command line:



macOS/Linux:

```bash
pip3 install streamrip --upgrade; pip3 install simple-term-menu
```

Windows:

```bash
pip3 install streamrip --upgrade; pip3 install windows-curses
```



If you would like to use `streamrip`'s conversion capabilities, install [ffmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org/download.html).

## Example Usage

**For Tidal and Qobuz, you NEED a premium subscription.**

Download an album from Qobuz

```bash
rip -u https://open.qobuz.com/album/0060253780968
```

![Streamrip downloading an album](https://github.com/nathom/streamrip/blob/main/demo/download_url.png?raw=true)

Download the album and convert it to `mp3`

```bash
rip --convert mp3 -u https://open.qobuz.com/album/0060253780968
```



To set the quality, use the `--quality` option to `0, 1, 2, 3, 4`:

| Quality ID | Audio Quality         | Available Sources    |
| ---------- | --------------------- | -------------------- |
| 0          | 128 kbps MP3 or AAC   | Deezer, Tidal        |
| 1          | 320 kbps MP3 or AAC   | Deezer, Tidal, Qobuz |
| 2          | 16 bit, 44.1 kHz (CD) | Deezer, Tidal, Qobuz |
| 3          | 24 bit, ≤ 96 kHz      | Tidal (MQA), Qobuz   |
| 4          | 24 bit, ≤ 192 kHz     | Qobuz                |





```bash
rip --quality 3 https://tidal.com/browse/album/147569387
```

Search for *Fleetwood Mac - Rumours* on Qobuz

```bash
rip search 'fleetwood mac rumours'
```

![streamrip interactive search](https://github.com/nathom/streamrip/blob/main/demo/interactive_search.png?raw=true)

Search for *Rumours* on Tidal, download it, convert it to `ALAC`

```bash

```

Qobuz discographies can be filtered using the `filter` subcommand

```bash
rip filter --repeats --features 'https://open.qobuz.com/artist/22195'
```
