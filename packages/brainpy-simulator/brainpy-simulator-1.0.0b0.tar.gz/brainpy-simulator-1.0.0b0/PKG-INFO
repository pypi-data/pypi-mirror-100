        **Note**: *BrainPy is a project under development. More features are coming soon. Contributions are welcome.*
        
        
        
        ## Why to use BrainPy
        
        ``BrainPy`` is an integrative framework for computational neuroscience and brain-inspired computation. Three core functions are provided in `BrainPy`:
        
        - *General numerical solvers* for ODEs and SDEs (future will support DDEs and FDEs).
        - *Neurodynamics simulation tools* for brain objects, such like neurons, synapses and networks (future will support soma and dendrites).
        - *Neurodynamics analysis tools* for differential equations, including phase plane analysis and bifurcation analysis (future will support continuation analysis and sensitive analysis).
        
        Moreover, `BrainPy` can effectively satisfy your basic requirements: 1. *Easy to learn and use*, because it is only based on Python language and has little dependency requirements; 2. *Highly flexible and transparent*, because it endows the users with the fully data/logic flow control; 3. *Simulation can be guided with the analysis*, because the same code in BrainPy can not only be used for simulation, but also for dynamics analysis; 4. *Efficient running speed*, because BrainPy is compatitable with the latest JIT compilers (or any other computing backend you prefer).

        ## Installation
        
        Install ``BrainPy`` by using ``pip``:
        
        ```bash
        > pip install --pre brainpy-simulator
        ```
        
        Install ``BrainPy`` by using ``conda``:
        
        ```bash
        > conda install brainpy-simulator -c brainpy
        ```
        
        Install ``BrainPy`` from source:
        
        ```bash
        > pip install git+https://github.com/PKU-NIP-Lab/BrainPy
        > # or
        > pip install git+https://git.openi.org.cn/OpenI/BrainPy
        > # or
        > pip install -e git://github.com/PKU-NIP-Lab/BrainPy.git@V0.2.5
        ```
