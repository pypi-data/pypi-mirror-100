For Developers
==============

This project follows the Pitchfork Layout (PFL).  Namespaces are encapsulated in separate directories. Any physical unit must only include headers within its namespace, the root namespace (core), or interface headers in other namespaces.  The build system discourages violations by making it difficult to link objects across namespaces.

Documentation for this project is dynamically generated with Doxygen and Sphinx. Comments in the source following Javadoc style are included in the docs. Non-documented comments, e.g. implementation notes, developer advice, etc. follow standard C++ comment style. This README and other documents should be written in the intersection of Markdown and reStructuredText <https://gist.github.com/dupuy/1855764> for best interoperability.
