# Just Another Konsole YouTube-Music

---

## Overview

I wanted to create this application so that I could use the command line to play music easily. I often play games and listen to music simultaneously but using either Spotify or playing music in a browser takes much-needed resources from my CPU and RAM.

I have spent a lot of time looking through numerous CLI based music players. But they either required setting up lots of things, needed premium features to function or sometimes flat out didn't work even after tinkering with them for hours. Hence I thought that instead of looking for a solution, I should code it myself.

So I present to you JAKYM, Just Another Konsole YouTube-Music.

## How It Works

- The program starts and runs two threads, one to input music into the playlist and the other to iterate over the playlist and download the corresponding music and play it.
- The youtube-dl library does most of the heavy lifting of both parsing links and downloading them into a suitable file format.
- The pydub and simpleaudio libraries provide cross-platform audio playback without any issues though setting up simpleaudio on windows takes some time.
- The program runs until user specifically types exit.
