        # Python + CUDA TDEs from Nikkhoo and Walter 2015
        
        CUDA and OpenCL-enabled fullspace triangle dislocation elements. Benchmarked at 130 million TDEs per second.
        
        See below for usage and installation instructions.
        
        ### Basics
        
        Howdy! Usage is really simple:
        
        ```
        import cutde.fullspace
        
        disp = cutde.fullspace.clu_disp(pts, tris, slips, 0.25)
        strain = cutde.fullspace.clu_strain(pts, tris, slips, nu)
        ```
        
        * `pts` is a `np.array` with shape `(N, 3)`
        * tris is a `np.array` with shape `(N, 3, 3)` where the second dimension corresponds to each vertex and the third dimension corresponds to the cooordinates of those vertices.
        * slips is a `np.array` with shape `(N, 3)` where `slips[:,0]` is the strike slip component, while component 1 is the dip slip and component 2 is the tensile/opening component.
        * the last parameter, nu, is the Poisson ratio. 
        
        IMPORTANT: N should be the same for all these arrays. There is exactly one triangle and slip value used for each observation point. 
        
        * The output `disp` is a `(N, 3)` array with displacement components in the x, y, z directions.
        * The output `strain` is a `(N, 6)` array representing a symmetric tensor. `strain[:,0]` is the xx component of strain, 1 is yy, 2 is zz, 3 is xy, 4 is xz, and 5 is  yz.
        
        ### I want stress.
        
        Use:
        
        ```
        stress = cutde.fullspace.strain_to_stress(strain, sm, nu)
        ```
        
        to convert from stress to strain assuming isotropic linear elasticity. `sm` is the shear modulus and `nu` is the Poisson ratio.
        
        ### All pairs
        
        If, instead, you want to create a matrix representing the interaction between every observation point and every source triangle, there is a different interface:
        
        ```
        import cutde.fullspace
        
        disp = cutde.fullspace.clu_disp_all_pairs(pts, tris, slips, 0.25)
        strain = cutde.fullspace.clu_strain_all_pairs(pts, tris, slips, nu)
        ```
        
        * `pts` is a `np.array` with shape `(N_OBS_PTS, 3)`
        * tris is a `np.array` with shape `(N_SRC_TRIS, 3, 3)` where the second dimension corresponds to each vertex and the third dimension corresponds to the cooordinates of those vertices.
        * slips is a `np.array` with shape `(N_SRC_TRIS, 3)` where `slips[:,0]` is the strike slip component, while component 1 is the dip slip and component 2 is the tensile/opening component.
        * the last parameter, nu, is the Poisson ratio. 
        * The output `disp` is a `(N_OBS_PTS, N_SRC_TRIS, 3)` array.
        * The output `strain` is a `(N_OBS_PTS, N_SRC_TRIS, 6)` array.
        
        Note that to use the `strain_to_stress` function, you'll need to reshape the output strain to be `(N_OBS_PTS * N_SRC_TRIS, 6)`.
        
        ### Installation
        
        Just run 
        ```
        pip install cutde
        ```
        
        Then, if you have an NVIDIA GPU, install PyCUDA with:
        
        ```
        conda install -c conda-forge pycuda
        ```
        
        If not, you'll need to install PyOpenCL. Installing OpenCL is sometimes a breeze and sometimes a huge pain, but it should be installable on most recent hardware and typical operating systems. [These directions can be helpful.](https://documen.tician.de/pyopencl/misc.html#installing-from-conda-forge). I am happy to try to help if you have OpenCL installation issues, but I can't promise to be useful. For me, on an Ubuntu + Intel machine, I just ran:
        ```
        conda install -c conda-forge pyopencl ocl-icd-system
        ```
        and everything worked wonderfully.
