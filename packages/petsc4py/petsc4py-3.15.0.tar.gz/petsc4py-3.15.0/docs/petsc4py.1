.SS Abstract
.sp
This document describes \fI\%petsc4py\fP, a \fI\%Python\fP port to the \fI\%PETSc\fP
libraries.
.sp
\fI\%PETSc\fP (the Portable, Extensible Toolkit for Scientific
Computation) is a suite of data structures and routines for the
scalable (parallel) solution of scientific applications modeled by
partial differential equations. It employs the \fI\%MPI\fP standard for
all message\-passing communication.
.sp
This package provides an important subset of PETSc functionalities
and uses \fI\%NumPy\fP to efficiently manage input and output of array data.

.SS Overview
.sp
\fI\%PETSc\fP is a suite of data structures and routines for the
scalable (parallel) solution of scientific applications modeled by
partial differential equations. It employs the \fI\%MPI\fP standard for all
message\-passing communication.
.sp
PETSc is intended for use in large\-scale application projects
[petsc\-efficient], and several ongoing computational science projects
are built around the PETSc libraries. With strict attention to
component interoperability, PETSc facilitates the integration of
independently developed application modules, which often most
naturally employ different coding styles and data structures.
.sp
PETSc is easy to use for beginners [petsc\-user\-ref]\&. Moreover, its
careful design allows advanced users to have detailed control over the
solution process. PETSc includes an expanding suite of parallel linear
and nonlinear equation solvers that are easily used in application
codes written in C, C++, and Fortran. PETSc provides many of the
mechanisms needed within parallel application codes, such as simple
parallel matrix and vector assembly routines that allow the overlap of
communication and computation.

.SS Components
.sp
PETSc is designed with an object\-oriented style. Almost all
user\-visible types are abstract interfaces with implementations that
may be chosen at runtime. Those objects are managed through handles to
opaque data structures which are created, accessed and destroyed by
calling appropriate library routines.
.sp
PETSc consists of a variety of components. Each component manipulates
a particular family of objects and the operations one would like to
perform on these objects. These components provide the functionality
required for many parallel solutions of PDEs.
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B Vec
Provides the vector operations required for setting up and
solving large\-scale linear and nonlinear problems. Includes
easy\-to\-use parallel scatter and gather operations, as well as
special\-purpose code for handling ghost points for regular data
structures.
.TP
.B Mat
A large suite of data structures and code for the manipulation
of parallel sparse matrices. Includes four different parallel
matrix data structures, each appropriate for a different class
of problems.
.TP
.B PC
A collection of sequential and parallel preconditioners,
including (sequential) ILU(k), LU, and (both sequential and
parallel) block Jacobi, overlapping additive Schwarz methods
and (through BlockSolve95) ILU(0) and ICC(0).
.TP
.B KSP
Parallel implementations of many popular Krylov subspace
iterative methods, including GMRES, CG, CGS, Bi\-CG\-Stab, two
variants of TFQMR, CR, and LSQR. All are coded so that they are
immediately usable with any preconditioners and any matrix data
structures, including matrix\-free methods.
.TP
.B SNES
Data\-structure\-neutral implementations of Newton\-like methods
for nonlinear systems. Includes both line search and trust
region techniques with a single interface. Employs by default
the above data structures and linear solvers. Users can set
custom monitoring routines, convergence criteria, etc.
.TP
.B TS
Code for the time evolution of solutions of PDEs. In addition,
provides pseudo\-transient continuation techniques for computing
steady\-state solutions.

.SS Installation
.SS Using \fBpip\fP
.sp
You can use \fBpip\fP to install \fBpetsc4py\fP and its
dependencies (\fBmpi4py\fP is optional but highly recommended):
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
$ python \-m pip install [\-\-user] numpy mpi4py  (or pip install [\-\-user] numpy mpi4py)
$ python \-m pip install [\-\-user] petsc petsc4py (or pip install [\-\-user] petsc petsc4py)
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
If you already have downloaded PETSc simply add the option –download\-petsc4py to the ./configure command you use for building PETSc.
.sp
Note that though the command has –download it doesn’t actually download anything, it uses the source
in the directory src/binding/petsc4py.
