# Probability Distribution package
Within this package a Binomial class and a Gaussian class is implemented.\
It helps generating and handling with Gaussian and Binomial distributions.

## Binomial class
**mean** - representing the mean value of the distribution\
**stdev** - representing the standard deviation of the distribution\
**data_list** -  list of floats to be extracted from the data file\
**p** - presenting the probability of an event occurring\
**n** - number of trials
        
## Gaussian class
**mean** - representing the mean value of the distribution\
**stdev** - representing the standard deviation of the distribution
