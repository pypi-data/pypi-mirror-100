Description: # DragonTide
        Continuous Command Recognition (CCR) for [Dragonfly](https://dragonfly2.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html)
        
        # Project Origins
        This project was forked from [dragonfluid](https://github.com/chajadan/dragonfluid). I have heard from others in the Dragonfly community that the original author is deceased, so I decided the best way forward for me would be to fork it and maintain a new version myself. 
        
        I've renamed the project to DragonTide to distinguish it from the original version of dragonfluid.
        
        I'd like to express my appreciation to [Charles J. Daniels](https://github.com/chajadan) for his excellent work developing this package, and I'd also like to express my heartfelt condolences to anyone who knew and loved him and is grieving his passing.
        
        # Developing
        ```python
        pip install -e '.[dev]'
        ```
