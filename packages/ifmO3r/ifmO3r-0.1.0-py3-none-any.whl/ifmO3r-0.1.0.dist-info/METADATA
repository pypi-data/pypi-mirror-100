# ifmO3r

## Getting started
Please see https://ifm3d.com/tutorial-welcome.html as a starting point.

## New python environment
To get the best experience, we recommend to use a blank python venv:
  `python -m venv [path/name_of_venv]`
Now you can choose to either use the local, wheel or pip installation.

## Local installation
To install and use the ifmO3r and the ifm3dTiny, you need to install this complete repository with:
`pip install -e [path to setup.py do not include the setup.py within the path]`
This will take care for the python path and dependencies.

## Site package install via wheel
You can also install this package via installing the wheel:
`pip install [path to wheel].whl`
This will be an installation to your python site packages.

## 3D viewer
The 3D viewer is also a package on PyPI. You can install the 3D viewer by `pip install ifmO3rViewer`
