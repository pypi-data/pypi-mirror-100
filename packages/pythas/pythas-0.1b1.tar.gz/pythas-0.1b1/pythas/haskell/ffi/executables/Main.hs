    This executable allows you to use the Haskell backend of the Python package 'Pythas' independently. It can create FFI bindings from a Haskell source file. The Python and Haskell package are closely related. Some of the provided wrapper types may have unconventional design due to limitations of Python's 'ctypes' library. The type definitions are given in the Pythas-Types package and can be used acress languages.

module Main where

import System.Environment (getArgs)

import Foreign.Pythas (createFileBindings', makePythasExportName)

{- |
    Parses a Haskell source file at @-i@ and creates a new module for which it will store at @-o@.
    The output file will contain @foreign export ccall@s for all those functions, where wrapping is possible.
    Lists are converted to @Foreign.Pythas.Arrays@, Strings also get their own type. This is due to the handling of these types by Python's 'ctypes'. Tuples with up to four fields can also be wrapped as C structs using the @c-structs@ package.
    It is not necessary to use @Foreign.C.Types@ in the source module. Conversion to these types will be done automatically. It is however necessary to provide type definitions for all functions that should be in the exports. Type synonyms and custom types are not (yet) supported.
