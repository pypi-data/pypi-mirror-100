Description: # Space Diner
        
        Space Diner is a sci-fi themed, text-based sim game. 
        The player runs a diner that is visited by customers from our solar system and beyond! 
        The goal is to serve each of them a meal that they like and that they can digest.
        The player's activities include taking orders, buying ingredients, and cooking.
        You can also get to know your regular customers and their stories.
