Description: # NES-PY
        
        A Nintendo Entertainment System (NES) emulator written in Python and Cython.  Currently in development.  All
        core components are implemented, although several important mappers are still to do and known bugs remain (along
        with lots of unknown ones!).
        
        With huge thanks to everyone who contributed to the amazing [NESDev Wiki](wiki.nesdev.com) and all the other fantastic
        sources, tests and forums for NES emulator development and 6502 progamming.
