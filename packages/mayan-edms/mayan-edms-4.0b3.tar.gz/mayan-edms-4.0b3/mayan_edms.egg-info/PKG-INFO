        Mayan EDMS is a document management system. Its main purpose is to store,
        introspect, and categorize files, with a strong emphasis on preserving the
        contextual and business information of documents. It can also OCR, preview,
        label, sign, send, and receive thoses files. Other features of interest
        are its workflow system, role based access control, and REST API.

        - Several renames for consistency. Use the major, minor, verb order
          for variable names in more places.
        - Point document to latest document version. This removes the document page

        - Add sources to their own menu.
        - Add ``mode`` argument to SharedUploadedFile.
        - Split document app model tests into separate modules.
        - Split document app test mixins into separate modules.
        - Fix the appearance of the automatically generated view titles.
        - Add a new "Return" menu for secondary object views.
        - Use the "Return" menu for the document version, document version page,
          document file, and document file page views.
        - Remove the "File..." reference to the document file form fields as these
          are now obvious.
        - Add more return links. From document version to version list, from
          document file to document file list, from document version page to
          document, from document file page to document.
        - Add document version edit view. Allows editing the document version comment.
        - Improve the return links with the chevron as the uniform secondary icon.
        - Rename the document view, document version view and document file views to
          document preview, document file preview and document version preview.

          filename.
        - Rename ``DeletedDocument`` to ``TrashedDocument``, same with the
          corresponding trashed fields and manager methods.
        - Add document file download event.
        - Rename all instances of ``icon_class`` to ``icon`` as only icon instances

          seen links.
        - Switch both view to mark notification as read to use the POST request

          partition purge permission.
        - Added ``ContentTypeTestCaseMixin``.
        - Include ``EventTestCaseMixin`` as part of the base test case mixin.
        - Rename usage of "recent document" to the more explicit "recently
          accessed document". This was done at the mode, view and API level.
          The recently accessed document API will now require the document view
          permission.
        - Rename the document model ``date_added`` field to ``datetime_created`` to
          better reflect the purpose of the field.
        - Add a ``RecentlyCreatedDocument`` proxy and associate the recent document
          columns to it.
        - Move the recently created document query calculation to its own model
          manager.
        - Add the recently created document API.
        - Add favorite documents API.
        - Rename the ``misc_models.py`` module to ``duplicated_document_models.py``.

        - Add date time field to the favorite documents models to ensure deterministic
          ordering when deleting the oldest favorites.
        - Rename the setting ``DOCUMENTS_RECENT_ACCESS_COUNT`` to
          ``DOCUMENTS_RECENTLY_ACCESSED_COUNT``, and ``DOCUMENTS_RECENT_ADDED_COUNT``
          to ``DOCUMENTS_RECENTLY_CREATED_COUNT``. Config file migrations and
          migration tests were added. Environment and supervisor settings need to be
          manually updated.
        - Docker Compose updates:
        
            - Use profiles for extra containers.
            - Converted to use extensions to remove duplicated markup.
            - A new container was added to mount an index.
            - Added support for Traefik.
            - Added sample .env file.
            - Update required Docker Compose to version 1.28.
        
        - Add a third document filename generator that used an UUID plus the original
          filename of the uploaded file. This generator has the advantage of producing
          unique filename while also preserving the original filename for reference.
        - Add support for the "Reply To" field for sending documents via email and
          for the mailing workflow actions. Closes GitLab issue #864. Thanks to
          Kevin Pawsey (@kevinpawsey) for the request.
        - Allow customization of the error condition when generating document images.
          This allows displaying more icons in addition to the generic document
          image error with additional contextual information and popup messages
          explaining the actual error condition.
