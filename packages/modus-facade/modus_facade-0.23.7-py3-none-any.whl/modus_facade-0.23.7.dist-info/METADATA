Modus Facade
============

## Deprecation Notice

*Deprecated and no longer supported. Please don't use this.*

This package is being left up for legacy support. It is not maintained and shouldn not be 
used.

DotModus wrapper for common Google Cloud Components.

Facade is now designed for python 3.5 and above.

For example:

- Logging (including Cloud Logging)
- Dataproc
- Compute
- Solr

Each facade module will be stored in its own directory. However, the entire
 facade module will be installable.

## Problems with google-api-client

The Google API Client has historically had a problem where it shared a 
 namespace with apiclient (another python package). As such, there can be 
 issues with certain parts of the googleapiclient package not being found. As 
 an example, a recent problem popped up running `dataproc.py` with the 
 following error:

 ```
 Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "dataproc-play.py", line 4, in <module>
    from modcloud import dataproc
  File "/Users/thomas/Development/facade/modcloud/dataproc.py", line 6, in <module>
    from googleapiclient.discovery import build
  File "/Users/thomas/.virtualenvs/scoop/lib/python2.7/site-packages/googleapiclient/discovery.py", line 53, in <module>
    import uritemplate
ImportError: No module named uritemplate
```

For some reason, I had managed to mess up the dependencies and needed to 
 reinstall the google-api-client with the following command, whcih resolved the
 problem:

```
pip install --force-reinstall google-api-python-client
```
