Description: DataConversion is a Python package that provides fast, flexible, and expressive data structures designed to make working with structured (tabular, multidimensional, potentially heterogeneous) and time series data both easy and intuitive. It aims to be the fundamental high-level building block for doing practical, real world data analysis in Python. Additionally, it has the broader goal of becoming the most powerful and flexible open source data analysis / manipulation tool available in any language. It is already well on its way toward this goal.
        
        pandas is well suited for many different kinds of data:
        
        Tabular data with heterogeneously-typed columns, as in an SQL table or Excel spreadsheet
        Ordered and unordered (not necessarily fixed-frequency) time series data.
        Arbitrary matrix data (homogeneously typed or heterogeneous) with row and column labels
        Any other form of observational / statistical data sets. The data actually need not be labeled at all to be placed into a pandas data structure
